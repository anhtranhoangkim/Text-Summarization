# 📝 Text Mining: Automatic Text Summarization

This project explores **Text Mining** techniques, focusing on **automatic text summarization** using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was developed as part of an academic group project at National Economics University.

We implemented and tested both **extractive** and **abstractive** summarization methods using real-world datasets, with a hands-on demo built in Python.
